Image to 3D Visualization by Detection in Augmented Reality

Overview
This project aims to enhance visual understanding in education by using Augmented Reality (AR) for 3D visualization. The application detects images using AR, making use of techniques like blob detection and corner detection to render visual representations. The goal is to provide an engaging learning experience by overlaying 3D models onto real-world scenes, making complex subjects more accessible to students.

üìö Abstract
Traditional 2D educational materials often fail to fully engage students, especially in complex subjects. This project introduces 3D visualization using AR, accessible on mobile devices, to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical learning. By pointing the camera at an image, the application uses an image training model for detection and renders a 3D visualization, enhancing the student's understanding.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Learning: Provides an engaging way to visualize and understand complex topics using 3D models.
Real-Time Detection: Uses blob and corner detection techniques to identify images in real time.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Accessible on mobile devices with AR capabilities.
Improved Visualization: Renders 3D models that are easy to understand, promoting better learning outcomes.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Hardware Requirements
Mobile device with a camera.
Software Requirements
Unity Game Engine: Used for developing the AR application with C# scripting.
AR Foundation Package: Provides the foundation for AR development within Unity.
ARCore: Google's SDK for building AR applications on Android devices.
Blender: Used for 3D modeling.

üöÄ How It Works
Scanning: The camera is used to scan text or images.
Detecting: Image detection uses trained models to recognize objects with techniques like blob and corner detection.
Rendering: Converts the detected objects into 3D visualizations through pose estimation using anchor points.
Representing: Displays the final 3D representation overlaid onto the real world.

üìù Project Flow
The project flow begins with scanning images using the device's camera, followed by image detection. Detection techniques like blob detection, corner detection, and edge detection are used to estimate pose and position virtual objects. Finally, the rendering process creates a realistic 3D visualization.
